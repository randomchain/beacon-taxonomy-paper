\citet{bunz2017proofsof} describe how na√Øve usage of blockchains as randomness source is easy to bias.
To improve on existing approaches they present a beacon based on randomness extracted from the bitcoin blockchain that uses a delay function to prevent manipulation.
The delay function serves to prevent manipulation like block-withholding attacks, that other blockchain-based beacons are vulnerable to.
Their beacon is based on electing an operator to run it, and contesting the operator to verify the output of the beacon. The beacon itself is unpredictable, publicly verifiable, and guarantees availability.
They also design the incentives for driving, contesting, and proving the correctness of the beacon to ensure correct behavior, and implement an Ethereum smart contract to do this.
This incentive structure is evaluated as a function of the monetary costs of executing Ethereum smart contracts combined with deposits of ether \mtjnote{TODO: define what ether is}.
