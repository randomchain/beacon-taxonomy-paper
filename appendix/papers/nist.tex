\papertitle{nistbeacon}
The \gls{nist} randomness beacon is one of, if not the most well-known randomness beacons today.
The beacon publishes timestamped and signed 512-bit strings of full randomness every 60 seconds.
The randomness is sourced from a source of quantum entanglement, and boasts extremely high-quality entropy.
However, there is no way for users to verify the randomness was generated in this way, so the beacon requires blind trust in the \acrfull{nist}.
