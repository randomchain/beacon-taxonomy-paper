\citet{bentov2016bitcoin} extend the work of \citet{bonneau2015bitcoin} by examining a transparent authority beacon protocol based on extracting randomness from a series of blocks on the bitcoin blockchain, as opposed to a single block.
Their beacon protocol is both unpredictable and publicly verifiable.
They also discuss and prove variety of attack strategies on the beacon from different types of adversaries.
Against an adversary that can produce bitcoin blocks at a loss indefinitely, it is impossible to extract data without a significant statistical distance from random.
Against budget-limited adversaries it is possible to extract randomness with a statistical distance from zero that is arbitrarily close to 0.
