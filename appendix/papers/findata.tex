\citet{clark2010use} present a publicly verifiable transparent authority randomness beacon with randomness extracted from publicly available stock market closing prices.
They evaluate the amount of entropy that can be extracted from stock prices using Monte Carlo simulations.
They extract data with a high level of entropy from the Standard \& Poor's 500 index with extractor functions, and publish it through a beacon.
