As a way to bootstrap cryptosystem constants \citet{baigneres2015trap} present a one-time public transparent authority randomness beacon based on lotteries in several countries.
From the lottery numbers to generate a random seed in a publicly verifiable manner.
This seed is then used for a Blum-Blum-Shub generator to bootstrap a cryptosystem.
Their approach is still vulnerable to last-draw attacks that could compromise the cryptosystem.
They do not propose to use the protocol as a beacon at regular intervals, but it can be extended to do so.
