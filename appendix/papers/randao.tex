\papertitle{randao}
While this is not based on any scientific paper, the \citealias{randao} is still a working example of public randomness.
The \citetalias{randao} is a smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain that makes randomness available to other smart contracts at a small fee.
Users use a commit-reveal scheme to contribute entropy that is combined in the contract to provide randomness.
The contract incentivizes users to contribute and obey protocol through deposits and sharing the profits from the randomness between contributing users.
If no users contribute or follow through the protocol, the contract will fail to provide randomness at a certain block of the chain.
As an Ethereum smart contract, the \citetalias{randao} is executed by all full nodes of the network.
