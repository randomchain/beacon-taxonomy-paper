Random numbers govern much;  they decide the fairness of a variety of lotteries and they are responsible for security in cryptographic schemes and modern communication.
A randomness beacon is a service that emits random numbers at regular intervals.
Everyone listening to this beacon will hear the same number, and this property enables transparency in applications that depend on randomness.% This is useful for auditing and verifying the use of randomness in many applications --- if the beacon is \enquote{honest} and sufficiently random, an entity drawing a lottery or designing cryptographic schemes will have no ability to bias or manipulate the process (at least not in the parts involving outcome of the randomness).

We conduct a survey of randomness beacons and their trustworthiness.
We establish a general randomness beacon definition, and provide the, to our knowledge, first taxonomy of existing approaches to creating such beacons.
We classify a total of 11 papers within three archetypes that cover trends within randomness beacons and similar work.
The archetypes are also analyzed to further explore the main directions of approaches to public randomness.
