\subsection{Non-Use-Cases}\label{sub:non_use_cases}
Randomness beacons are not a universal solution in all situations requiring randomness.

\stefan{Actually it would be nice if at the end of the section you could give some examples of "Non-Use-Cases": are there situations where random beacons are not a good choice? e.g., to use it as inputs for crypto functions (because then many people use the same private key or given the time when the private key was generated I know which key it is?)}
