\subsection{Non-Use-Cases}\label{sub:non_use_cases}
Randomness beacons are not a universal solution in all situations requiring randomness. Generallyâ€š randomness beacons are useful in situations where all parties are mutually distrustful, or situations where transparency in the random number generation is beneficial. In cases where only one person needs a random number, and that person also generates it, there is no need to use a randomness beacon --- he can trust himself.

A concrete use case in which randomness beacons are not useful is the generation of key pairs. Note that algorithms for generating these key pairs may contain constants that benefit from being chosen by a randomness beacon~\cite{baigneres2015trap}. However, the random seed required in the algorithm for generating the key pair should be privately generated to avoid the likely situation where two people use the same randomness beacon output and end up with the same key pair. 

\stefan{Actually it would be nice if at the end of the section you could give some examples of "Non-Use-Cases": are there situations where random beacons are not a good choice? e.g., to use it as inputs for crypto functions (because then many people use the same private key or given the time when the private key was generated I know which key it is?)}
