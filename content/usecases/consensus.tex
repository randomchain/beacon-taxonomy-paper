\subsection{Consensus Algorithms}\label{subsec:usecase_consensus_algorithms}
Randomness is also useful for consensus algorithms. The blockchain proof-of-stake protocol relies on the ability to pick a random unit of currency, and allows it's owner to mine the next block. Since block-mining carries a monetary reward within cryptocurrencies, there is a large incentive to keep the randomness fair and unbiased for all stakeholders.
