%\subsection{Sharding in Blockchains}\label{subsec:usecase_sharding}
%Sharding is a common way of scaling decentralized blockchains~\cite{croman2016scaling}. It refers to splitting the state of the blockchain into multiple parts and having a distinct participant group assigned to each shard. This partition of the network should be bias-resistant, such that an adversary cannot affect the partitioning to their advantage~\cite{kokoris2017omniledger}.
