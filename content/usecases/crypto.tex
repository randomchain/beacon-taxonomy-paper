\subsection{Cryptography}\label{subsec:usecase_cryptography}
Randomness and unpredictability is also an important part of modern cryptography. The strength of security protocols is often expressed as a number of bits an attacker needs to guess to execute a successful attack. It follows, that the harder it is to guess a bit, i.e.\ the higher the entropy of your data source, the more secure your protocol is. 
Randomness is also used as the foundation of cryptographic primitives like zk-SNARKs \srknote[inline]{TODO: Source}. The randomness at the foundation of this primitive allows proving information without revealing it.
