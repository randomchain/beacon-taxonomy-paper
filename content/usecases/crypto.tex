\subsection{Cryptography}\label{subsec:usecase_cryptography}
Randomness and unpredictability is also an important part of modern cryptography. The strength of security protocols is often expressed in a number of bits, the attackers needs to guess to execute a succesful attack. It follows that the harder it is to guess a bit, i.e. the higher the entropy of your data source, the more secure your protocol is. 
Randomness is also used as the foundation of cryptographic primitives like ZkSnarks (kilde). The randomness at the foundation of this primitive allow proving information without revealing it.
