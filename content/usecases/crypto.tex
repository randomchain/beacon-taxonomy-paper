\subsection{Cryptography}\label{subsec:usecase_cryptography}
Randomness and unpredictability is also an important part of modern cryptography. The strength of security protocols is often expressed as a number of bits an attacker needs to guess to execute a successful attack. It follows, that the harder it is to guess a bit, i.e.\ the higher the entropy of your data source, the more secure your protocol is. However you still need to trust the source of randomness to not be biased or controlled by an adversary to trust the encryption. 
However, randomness is not usable for all kinds of cryptography --- e.g.\ private encryption keys should used from publicly available randomness. 
%Randomness is also used as the foundation of cryptographic primitives like zk-SNARKs \srknote[inline]{TODO: Source}. The randomness at the foundation of this primitive allows proving information without revealing it.
