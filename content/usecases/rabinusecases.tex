\citet{rabin1983transaction} motivated his invention of the beacon with an example. If two parties, $A$ and $B$, want to negotiate a contract, they each want the other party to sign it. 
However, if $A$ signs it and sends it to $B$, then $B$ will be in a position of strength, since $A$ has already committed to it, while $B$ is not. $B$ can decide to sign it or abandon it. Avoiding this situation is desired in a \emph{fair} contract signing protocol.

Rabin proposes such a protocol that involves a beacon broadcasting random numbers.

Assume $A$ wants to disclose confidential information if $B$ promises not to divulge it. The protocol should prevent that $B$ obtains the information without leaving $A$ with a receipt that
