\subsection{Fair Contract Signing}\label{subsec:fair_contract_signing}
\citet{rabin1983transaction} motivated his invention of the beacon with an example. If two parties, $A$ and $B$, want to negotiate a contract, they each want the other party to sign it. 
However, if $A$ signs it and sends it to $B$, then $B$ will be in a position of strength, since $A$ has already committed to it, while $B$ is not. $B$ can decide to sign it or abandon it. Avoiding this situation is desired in a \emph{fair} contract signing protocol.

The usual way of overcoming this problem is using an intermediary trusted by both parties. However, if no such intermediary can be found, Rabin proposes using a fair contract signing protocol that involves a beacon broadcasting random numbers. The beacon output is used as the trusted intermediary to provide a known probabilistic guarantee that neither of the parties can cheat. \todo{Maybe we should be more specific?}
