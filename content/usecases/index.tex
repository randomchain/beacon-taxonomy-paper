\section{Use Cases of Randomness Beacons}\label{sec:use_cases_of_randomness_beacons}
Randomness beacons are good solutions to a wide variety of problems.
To better grasp their usefulness, we present the following use cases.
Note that the following is not exhaustive of the cases where a beacon might be used.
However, it will provide a sense of the problem domain, in which beacons are used.
\stefan{Actually it would be nice if at the end of the section you could give some examples of "Non-Use-Cases": are there situations where random beacons are not a good choice? e.g., to use it as inputs for crypto functions (because then many people use the same private key or given the time when the private key was generated i know which key it is?)}
