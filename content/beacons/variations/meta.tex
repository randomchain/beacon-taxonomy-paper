\section{Randomness Beacon Variations}
Given the properties defined in the previous section, we seek to elaborate on the numerous variations of beacons that can exist.
To do this, we define attributes, settings, trust assumptions, and attacks, which can be compiled into specifications of randomness beacons.
Depending on the combination of these, a given beacon specification will then adhere to the aforementioned properties with varying degree.
