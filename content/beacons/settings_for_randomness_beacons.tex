\subsection{Settings for Randomness Beacons}
%   Settings for beacons:
Since randomness beacons are a versatile and broad concept, they can be deployed in vastly different settings.
These settings all alter the way the beacon operates and how users interact with it.
Furthermore, it affects which shape the beacon implementation takes, i.e.\ different technologies better suit varying settings.

There are two main distinctions when dealing with settings of a randomness beacon --- \emph{private} and \emph{public}.
\stefan{hmm... private and public is a bit confusing. because private can be more than a single person? maybe permissioned and permissionless? hmm... or why not make it general: define a set S of users, and if S is not everybody, we call it private, otherwise public?}
Within these categories are then different views on trust, scalability, intent, and incentives.

\subsubsection{Private Setting}
In a private setting it is safe to assume \stefan{I disagree. why in a private setting there may not be cheaters!?} that no participant will be obviously malicious, i.e.\ an adversary will not risk being caught red-handed since it would exclude him from the network.
However, we can suspect that an adversary will try to manipulate the outcome of a randomness beacon if possible --- all users are anticipated to seek whatever benefits themselves.
This means that all detectable manipulation and malicious activities will be avoided by the participants of the private network.

We also assume that the continuous operation of a randomness beacon is a requirement for the private network, which means that all participants have an incentive to ensure timely execution.
Unless a participant can benefit from the beacon not outputting, in which case they might simulate e.g.\ network issues to disrupt the beacon.

Scalability might be an issue in larger private networks, however, generally private networks are small enough that scaling is not a great concern.

\subsubsection{Public Setting}
No guarantees can be made when it comes to public networks, such as the internet.
We can assume that all participants will try to manipulate the beacon outcome to their advantage, no matter the cost.
Whether they have the resources available to do so, is besides the point.
Likewise, any individual user might also in some cases suspect that all other users are colluding against them.

In the public setting, all participants may not have a stake in the randomness beacon operating constantly.
Therefore, it is important to have established incentives for both users to use the beacon, but also for the execution of the beacon protocol if it relies on users.

Because public settings are almost infinitely large, i.e.\ any user should be able to join, scalability is a key concern --- availability requires scalability.
