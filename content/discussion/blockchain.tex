\subsection{Blockchains}
Blockchains are used widely within the beacon litterature, both as an source of input \cite{bonneau2015bitcoin, bentov2016bitcoin, bunz2017proofsof} and as a platform to run a beacon \cite{randao, bunz2017proofsof}. The blockchain has a strong foundation of verifiability that makes it easier to run a trustworthy service like a randomness beacon.
