% Why do we need publicly verifiable randomness
The world of today is increasingly aware of trust. Now, more than ever, many people are suspicious of who to trust. Numerous leaks have revealed aggressive espionage by governments, and as media coverage is dedicated to the aftermath of numerous leaks by WikiLeaks, we grow more suspicious of sharing our private information. We don't trust authorities as we now know they may be corrupt.

Decentralized approaches like Bitcoin rises in popularity. People don't trust large organizations.
