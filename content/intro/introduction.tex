\section{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}

% Intro + brief use cases
Random numbers are useful, important, and even critical, prerequisites in many areas.
Lotteries~\cite{grumbach2017distributed}, sports and military drafts~\cite{nbalottery, starr1997nonrandom}, and games and gambling~\cite{randomnumbersgames} all rely on random numbers.
Cryptographic schemes used in e.g.\ modern communication contain constants that exhibit randomness~\cite{baigneres2015trap}.
Also in academia, random numbers are required in e.g.\ randomized trials~\cite{kim2014random} and simulations of unpredictable processes~\cite{heath2002scientific}, and in computer science, using randomized algorithms~\cite{cormen2009introduction} is one use case.

% Integrity is important
Many of these examples happen in a public setting where people depend on the outcome of the random draw --- in other words, they have a stake in the value of the random number.
This can for example be a monetary prize, an advantage, or a disadvantage, and in the case of cryptography, randomly chosen constants help guard confidential information.
Thus, the quality and integrity of such random number is important, and since money, advantages, disadvantages, and information is at stake, adversaries should be assumed to be ready to manipulate the randomness in every way imaginable.

% Examples of intern manipulation and outside manipulation
As a recent example, the information security director of the American Multi-State Lottery Association, Eddie Tipton, was charged with installing a rootkit on the computer generating the random numbers, resulting in him winning the \$14.3 million prize~\cite{lotteryscandal-eddietipton}.
Another famous example is from 1980, where the host of lottery television broadcast switched out some ping pong balls with slightly heavier ones, resulting in a highly biased draw~\cite{lotteryscandal-666}.
As seen in these lottery examples, people within the entity generating the random numbers may manipulate the result, but powerful outside entities may also have an interest.
Such an entity is the \gls{nsa}, and leaks about them in the past decade revealing massive manipulation and the deliberate inclusion of backdoors in cryptographic schemes by carefully choosing \enquote{random} numbers~\cite{nytimes-nsaconstants,nytimes-nsabackdoors} have aggravated the question of trust.
In any case, having blind faith in an entity is not desirable --- people should not \emph{need} to trust an entity to do it right.

To our knowledge, random draws in many use cases are usually performed on-demand.
When lottery entities need the result, they perform the draw of some ping pong balls or use a computer to generate a random number. When cryptographic designers need a constant, they generate one~\cite{baigneres2015trap}.
Even though they may describe their process, it is difficult for them to prove their execution of it, and even if they can prove the execution, on-demand random numbers are still not trustworthy. To cheat, they could keep generating an on-demand value until a \enquote{satisfactory} one is found and then publish it.

A solution to the problem of trustworthy randomness is to use a \emph{randomness beacon}.
Michael Rabin introduced this term in 1983~\cite{rabin1983transaction} to describe a trusted public service that provides fresh randomness at regular intervals.
An entity wishing to use a random number should then:
\begin{eromanate*}
    \item announce a function mapping the beacon output space to their desired space; this desired space could for example be lottery numbers between 1 and 36, and
    \item announce a specific time in the future at which point the beacon output will be used.
\end{eromanate*}
This tactic delegates the trust issue to the randomness beacon.
The entity commits to using a future unknown random number which effectively makes the entity unable to keep requesting values until a satisfactory value is found.
Furthermore, anyone can see the same random value of the beacon and verify the outcome by using the announced mapping (and of course verify the mapping is fair).

This still leaves the problem of trusting the beacon to not bias the random number.
As an example, the \gls{nist} in USA, runs a randomness beacon that uses a setup measuring quantum mechanical effects to produce random numbers.
There is, however, no proof that the value has been generated by the quantum mechanical procedure as they claim.
Users have to blindly trust that the value is generated as described.
Furthermore, the reputation of the \gls{nist} is somewhat tarnished, as they were involved in the publication of the Dual Elliptic Curve PRNG standard, which they now have admitted contained a backdoor~\cite{nist2014backdoor}.
While there to our knowledge, exists no cases where \gls{nist} have biased the outcome, they have the ability to.

Some literature exists on making randomness beacons more trustable, and we find it desirable to investigate such concept of trust.
We have not been able to find extensive research on the topic, but the existing research is promising, and this paper will therefore try to classify these to give an overview of the topic.
