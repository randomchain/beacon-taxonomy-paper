\section{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}

% Random numbers
Randomness and the ability to generate random numbers is crucial in many applications and use cases;
ranging from lotteries and random draws, to generating complex parameters for cryptography and driving consensus algorithms.
This dependence on randomness, merits the question of how can we trust that acclaimed randomness truly is random, and has not been manipulated to benefit some adversary.

% General scare. "Mistrust" is rising.
Numerous leaks revealing aggressive espionage and misuse of information by authorities have surfaced the past decade.
Large corporations and authorities, has on several occasions misused the trust of the people.
In the light of events such as the unveiling of mass surveillance by the NSA or the backdoors, to commonly used systems, possessed by government agencies, a new era of mistrust has begun.

As an anti-thesis to the centralized organizations and authorities, there has been a surge of interest in decentralization and verifiability.
Many new trustless and decentralized technologies have emerged, most prominently the blockchain which has brought Bitcoin and other decentralized virtual currencies.

There are several approaches to providing a trustable randomness source; however, to the best of our knowledge, these solutions have not yet been classified, analysed, and compared.
Furthermore, parameters for comparison have not been established to facilitate such a taxonomy.

\subsection*{Contributions}\label{subsec:contributions}
% comparison parameters
In this paper, we establish a tangible set of parameters which can be used to classify different approaches to implement trustable randomness.
% actual taxonomy
Moreover, we provide the first taxonomy of such implementations alongside theoretical solutions and idea, which seeks to improve the trustability of randomness sources.

% blockchain magic to the rescue
We also introduce new ways of improving existing solutions, by harnessing the immutability and consensus power of blockchain networks.
