\subsection{Trust Assumptions}
\label{sub:trust_assumptions}
We use the following categories of trust assumptions in our taxonomy. 
\begin{description}
    \item [Entropy level lower bounded] The output's level of entropy is at least as high as the highest level of entropy provided in the input. 
    \item [Verifiability] The correctness of the inputs and the protocol execution can be verified by users. 
    \item [User Input] The protocol is based on user inpit, so we can not trust other users to not be malicious \gls{nsa} agents, but contributing our own entropy eliminates the need to trust them. 
\end{description}
