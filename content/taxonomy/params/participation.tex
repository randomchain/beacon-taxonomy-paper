\subsection{Participation Model}
\label{sub:participation_model}
\begin{description}
    \item [User input] The protocol allows users to provide entropy for the entropy. This can open up for direct manipulation of the result by last-draw attacks and the like. If this is the only source of entropy, lack of inputs deny availability of the randomness.  
    \item [External Entropy] The protocol uses some external source of entropy to produce randomness, such as the blockchain. Anyone wishing to influence it must influence the external source. 
    \item [Distributed Computation]
    The computation of the protocol is done in a distributed manner between a set of parties. 
    \item [Central operator] The protocol is computed by some central operator. For obvious reasons, this approach can not be trusted unless the computation is publicly verifiable.
