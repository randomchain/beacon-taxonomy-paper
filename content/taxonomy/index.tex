\section{A Taxonomy of Randomness Beacons}
\label{sec:a_taxonomy_of_randomness_beacons}
We will classify different approaches to creating randomness beacons, while focussing on trust.
This means that we will direct attention to, how a given user of the randomness beacon can trust it, and if they should trust it.
Alongside picking out short comings of the different approaches, we will examine where they excel compared to both each other but also current solutions for public randomness.
