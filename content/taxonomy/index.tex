\section{A Taxonomy of Randomness Beacons}
\label{sec:a_taxonomy_of_randomness_beacons}
We will classify different approaches to creating randomness beacons, while focusing on trust.
This means that we will direct attention to how a given user of the randomness beacon can trust it, and if they should trust it.
Alongside picking out shortcomings of the different approaches, we will examine where they excel compared to both each other and current solutions for public randomness.
