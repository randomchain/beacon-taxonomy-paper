\subsubsection{Trust Assumptions}
\label{ssub:trust_assumptions}
Dependent on the operation of and interaction with a given randomness beacon, users may assume different things about the trust of said beacon.
\begin{description}
    \item [Guaranteed Entropy Level] The beacon protocol guarantees that there is lower bound of entropy in the output.
    \item [Verifiability] The correctness of the inputs and the protocol execution can be verified by users.
    \item [User Input] The protocol is based on user input, so we can not trust other users to not be colluding, but contributing our own entropy eliminates the need to trust them.
\end{description}
