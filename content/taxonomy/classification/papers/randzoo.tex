\item[A Random Zoo: sloth, unicorn \& trx]
To make randomness trustable for situations with large interests, \citet*{lenstra2015random} present a way to generate trustable randomness from a variety of entropy sources, including user input or even third-party sources.
They use a slow but rapidly verifiable hashing function for incontestable random number generation. The slowness of the function is estimated from a single core, and given an theoretical lower bound of two minutes. By using a slow function and committing to the input they can generate a random number that can not be contested. This property is also shown in a formal proof.
While the paper does not directly present a beacon, it shares some properties with a transparent authority beacon, such as being unpredictable, publicly available, verifiable and using data from a third party.
Security is guaranteed by the slow function, as the output can not be known before it has been computed, which takes too long to hide.   % MTJ note: Does this mean that even though users want to contest the output, they can't? Should be clarified
