\item[A Random Zoo: sloth, unicorn \& trx]
\citet*{lenstra2015random} present a way to generate trustable randomness from a variety of entropy sources. They use a slow but rapidly verifiable hashing function for incontestable random number generation. % MTJ note: Does this mean that even though users want to contest the output, they can't? Should be clarified
