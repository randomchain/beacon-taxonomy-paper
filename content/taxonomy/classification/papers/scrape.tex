\item [SCRAPE: Scalable Randomness Attested by Public Entities]
\citet*{cascudo2017scrape} address the problem of \gls{mpc} randomness beacons scaling poorly. They create a randomness beacon based on an efficient coin tossing protocol between users with an honest majority posting in a public ledger. The protocol relies on a publicly verifiable secret sharing scheme for threshold access that only requires O(n) exponentiations. They evaluate the protocols performance both theoretically and practically to show its performance compared to similar algorithms. The protocol is also publicly verifiable, has guaranteed output delivery, and scales well, but ultimately relies on having an honest majority to compute it.
