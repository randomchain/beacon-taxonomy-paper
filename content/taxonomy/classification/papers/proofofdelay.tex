\item[Proofs-of-Delay and Randomness Beacons in Ethereum]
\citet{bunz2017proofsof} present a beacons based on randomness extracted from the bitcoin blockchain. They use a delay function to prevent manipulation, and clarify the incentives for driving, contesting and proving the correctness of the beacon. They also implement an Ethereum smart contract to do this.
