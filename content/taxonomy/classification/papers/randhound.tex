\item[Scalable Bias-Resistant Distributed Randomness]
\citet{syta2017scalable} design a pair of \gls{mpc} protocols for producing randomness on demand, RandHound,  and at predefined intervals, Randherd. Their protocols guarantee unbiasability, unpredictability and availability, and are based on publicly verifiable secret sharing schemes.  They make the protocol scalable by using sharding. The output of the RandHerd beacon protocol is also verifiable. Both protocols can have their availability compromised by having too many malicious nodes involved.
