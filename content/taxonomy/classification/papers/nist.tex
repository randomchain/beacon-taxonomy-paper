\papertitle{NIST Beacon}
The NIST randomness beacon \cite{nistbeacon} is one of, if not the most well-known randomness beacons today. The beacon publishes timestamped and signed 512-bit strings of full randomness every 60 seconds. The randomness is sourced from a source of quantum entanglement, and boasts extremely high-quality entropy. However, there is no way for users to verify the randomness was generated in this way, so the beacon requires blind trust in the NIST.
