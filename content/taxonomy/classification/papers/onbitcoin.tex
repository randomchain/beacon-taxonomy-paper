\papertitle{On Bitcoin as a Source of Public Randomness}
To renew interest in cryptographic beacons \citet{bonneau2015bitcoin} theoretically formalize using the blockchain as a source of publicly verifiable randoms by defining extractor functions, beacons, attacks and manipulation for beacons that use the blockchain for entropy.
They also implement a beacon operation in the bitcoin scripting language.
The beacon is publicly accessible and verifiable, and has a minimum entropy that scales with the current proof-of-work difficulty of the bitcoin blockchain.
They show how it can be manipulated by adversaries that control either a significant amount of mining power or network power, a result that is also supported by \citet{pierrot2016malleability}.
