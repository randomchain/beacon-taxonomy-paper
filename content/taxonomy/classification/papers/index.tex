\subsection{Paper Summaries}\label{sec:papersummaries}
We will shortly summarize the papers, to establish a ground for further analytic expansion.

\stefan{all of a sudden we mainly (only) talk about blockchains / bitcoin. that is unexpected as so far blockchains were not important. please omtivate this bbetter}

\fxfatal{Maybe we should not introduce the papers in a description of each? Instead, we could introduce them more "fluently" like "A does this, B improves on this, while another approach is C. D combines the results from A and C." }

%here goes the papers
