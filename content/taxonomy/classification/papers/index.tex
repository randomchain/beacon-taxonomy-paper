\subsection{Paper Summaries}\label{sec:papersummaries}
We will shortly summarize the papers that we analyze as part of our taxonomy.

\stefan{all of a sudden we mainly (only) talk about blockchains / bitcoin. that is unexpected as so far blockchains were not important. please omtivate this bbetter}

\fxfatal{Maybe we should not introduce the papers in a description of each? Instead, we could introduce them more "fluently" like "A does this, B improves on this, while another approach is C. D combines the results from A and C." }

%foreach(p in papers){
%   write(p.motivation);
%   write(p.contribution);
%   write(p.evaluation);
%   write(p.connectionToOurBeaconDefs);

%}
%yes im aware the syntax could be better, but it organizes thoughts.

%here goes the papers - need to fiddle with order to deliver message.
%Maybe we should also add NIST beacon, since we use it to compare. Also RANDAO?
