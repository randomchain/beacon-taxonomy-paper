\section{Acknowledgements}\label{sec:acknowledgements}
We would like to thank our supervisor Stefan Schmid for great feedback, ideas, and helpful discussions; and Yvonne-Anne Pignolet for interesting and engaging discussions on blockchain and randomness.
Furthermore, we extend our thanks and best wishes to two previous group members, who unfortunately decided that bitcoin churning was more interesting than randomness beacons.
