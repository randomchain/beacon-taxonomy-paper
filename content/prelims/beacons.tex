\subsection{Random Beacon Technology}
A random beacon is a method, possibly involving a trusted party, of generating uniform random strings that are unknown before the moment of their generation~\cite{andrychowicz2014distributed}
\stefan{what does "are not know" mean: cannot be known (due to entropy) or impossible to compute (due to NP-hardness) or? Whenever you are not concrete, then at least say "informally, ..."} 
\stefan{is that all? should it not have additional properties like "verifiability"?}.
Beacons are hard to construct, and often rely on trusted third parties like the \acrfull{nist}~\cite{nistbeacon} or Random.org\footnote{\url{https://www.random.org}}.
If the beacon wants to avoid relying on third parties it can use publicly available data.
An example of such data could be blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain, which has been proposed before~\cite{bonneau2015bitcoin} \stefan{i think this sentence should go in intro. here in the background section you should rather focus on defining requirements}.

A randomness beacon is constructed by, at regular intervals, applying a deterministic computation on some input (entropy), as depicted in~\cref{fig:beacon}. The output of the computation is a random value that has the property of being \emph{unpredictable} \todo{Define what this means}.

        \path[arrow, swap] (computation) -- (output);

    \caption{The broad structure of a randomness beacon. A deterministic computation performed on some input entropy leads to an output of randomness. This process should be repeated at regular intervals. \stefan{explain these components and why they are needed. Why not directly use the entropy? what properties should the computation have? what properties the randomness at the outbut? }}\label{fig:beacon}
