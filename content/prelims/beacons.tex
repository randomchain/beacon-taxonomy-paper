\subsection{Random Beacon Technology}
A random beacon is a method, possibly involving a trusted party, of generating uniform random strings that are unknown before the moment of their generation~\cite{andrychowicz2014distributed}.
Beacons are hard to construct, and often rely on trusted third parties like the \acrfull{nist}~\cite{nistbeacon} or Random.org\footnote{\url{https://www.random.org}}.
If the beacon wants to avoid relying on third parties it can use publicly available data.
An example of such data could be blocks in the bitcoin blockchain, which has been proposed before~\cite{bonneau2015bitcoin}.
