\subsection{Random Beacon Technology}
A random beacon is a method, possibly involving a trusted party, of generating uniform random strings that are unknown before the moment of their generation~\cite{andrychowicz2014distributed}. Beacons such as these have a number of uses. Beacons are hard to construct, and often rely on trusted third parties like the \acrfull{nist}~\cite{nistbeacon} or Random.org\footnote{\url{https://www.random.org}}. If we want to avoid relying on third parties we can use publicly available data. An example of such data could be blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain, which has been proposed before~\cite{bonneau2015bitcoin}.
