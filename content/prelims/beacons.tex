\subsection{Random Beacon Technology}
A random beacon is a method, possibly involving a trusted party, of generating uniform random strings that are unknown before the moment of their generation %\cite{andrychowicz2014distributed}. Beacons such as these have a number of uses. Beacons are hard to construct, and often rely on trusted third parties like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) \cite{nistbeacon} or Random.org \cite{randomorg}. If we want to avoid relying on third parties we can use publicly available data. An example of such data could be blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain, which has been proposed before \cite{bonneau2015bitcoin}.
