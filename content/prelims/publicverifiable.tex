\subsection{Public verifiability}
Public verifiability is the ability for any user to verify the results of a computation are correct. This can often be tied to asymmetric functions that are hard to compute, but easy to verify the results of, as a way to eliminate the need for trust. It is a useful property in distributed computation, as it removes the need to trust the computing parties when anyone can verify whether they behaved legally or not.
