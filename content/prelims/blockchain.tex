\subsection{Blockchain}\label{subsec:blockchain}
The blockchain is an append-only public ledger that most notably serves as the backbone of the bitcoin cryptocurrency.
It is a peer-to-peer network within which users can perform transactions between each other.
Transactions are recorded into a chain of blocks, each pointing to the previous one, that make up the blockchain.
Users compete for the right to make the blocks, as the action is rewarded.
A consensus algorithm is applied to ensure a constant flow of correct, agreed upon blocks.
The correctness of each block is publicly verifiable by every user in the blockchain.

We consider the blockchain primarily for how it uses public verification to eliminate the need for trusted parties, is able to establish consensus, and how it provides a strong base for verifiable peer-to-peer interactions.
