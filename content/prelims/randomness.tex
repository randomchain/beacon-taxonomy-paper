\subsection{Randomness}
Randomness can be seen as unpredictable information. Ideally, it can not be predicted or influenced in any way, hence why it can be used as a source of impartial decisions, e.g.\ for lotteries.
However, computers are not random. Computers are intrinsically deterministic, and thus can not produce true randomness. Instead, they can generate it by observing highly unpredictable information like atmospheric noise and radioactive decay, or use complicated algorithms to generate pseudorandomness that seems unpredictable~\cite{randomsources}.
The predictability of a source of data is measured in entropy. The higher the level of entropy, the harder it is to predict the data produced by the source, and vice versa. High level entropy can also be obtained from data with lower levels by using extractor functions \cite{pseudorandomness}.
