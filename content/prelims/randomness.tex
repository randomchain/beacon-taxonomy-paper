\subsection{Randomness}
Randomness can be seen as completely unpredictable information. Ideally it can not be predicted or influenced in any way, hence why it can be used as a source of impartial decisions, e.g. for lotteries.
However, computers are not random. Computers are intrinsically deterministic, and thus can not produce true randomness. Instead, they can generate it by observing highly unpredictable information like atmospheric noise and radioactive decay, or use complicated algorithms to scramble data in ways that seem unpredictable \cite{randomsources}.
The predictability of a source of data is measured in entropy. The higher the level of entropy, the harder it is to predict the data produced by the source, and vice versa.
