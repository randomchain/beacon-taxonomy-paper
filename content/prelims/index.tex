\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}
This section will clarify the two concepts \emph{randomness} and \emph{blockchain}.
\stefan{in a paper it is usually preferred not to introduce too many preliminaries that are not directly relevant or motivated yet. so I think I would not intorduce blockchain here but only later when it is needed? }
While we used the term randomness loosely in the introduction, a formalization will be required. The other concept, blockchains, is useful to understand in order to grasp some of the related work.
